title: GAN Applications


## GANs for Data Augmentation and Privacy

### Learning Objectives

- Explore different applications of GANs and examine their specific applications in data augmentation, privacy, and anonymity.
- Improve your downstream AI models with GAN-generated data.


## Image To Image Translation with Pix2Pix

### Learning Objectives


- Learn and leverage the image-to-image translation framework.
- Identify extensions, generalizations, and applications of this framework to modalities beyond images.
- Implement a paired image-to-image translation GAN, called Pix2Pix, to turn satellite images into map routes (and vice versa), with advanced U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator architectures.

## Unpaired Translation with CycleGAN

### Learning Objectives


- Compare paired image-to-image translation to unpaired image-to-image translation.
- Identify how their key difference necessitates a different GAN architecture.
- Implement unpaired image-to-image translation model, called CycleGAN, to adapt horses to zebras (and vice versa) with two GANs in one.
