## GAN Disadvantages and Bias


### Objectives

- Propose generative model alternatives to GANs and their pros/cons.
- Scrutinize bias in machine learning and examine its various sources.
- Describe an application of GANs that demonstrates bias.
- Explain several definitions of fairness in machine learning.

## StyleGAN and Advancements

- Analyze key advancements of GANs.
- Build and compose the components of StyleGAN.
- Investigate the controllability, fidelity, and diversity of StyleGAN outputs.
